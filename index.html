  <p id="o">Walmart has been changing the face of retail since our first store opened in 1962. We’ve
    continued to pursue ways to bring technology into retail to offer customers a seamless shopping experience. You can
    find a ton of items in a Walmart store, but as customers increasingly shop across digital and physical storefronts,
    we’ve made it easier for you to find what you need right at your fingertips. With innovations like Curbside Pickup,
    Mobile Scan & Go and a whole host of apps, we’re providing customers with more ways to save time and money while
    reimagining how digital and physical shopping work together.</p>
  <br>
  <ul style="color:#FCDE75;">
    <li>Walmart App – From Walmart Pay to Mobile Express Returns, prescription refills and grocery orders with same-day
      pickup, we help you get more done with just the touch of a button.</li>
    <li>Mobile Scan & Go – Shop and checkout with your phone in-store.</li>
    <li>Curbside Pickup – Order online, pickup in store.</li>
    <li>NextDay Delivery – In many markets, customers can enjoy fast, free shipping on eligible orders over $35.</li>
    <li class="cba">Walmart+ – Membership program that brings together in-store and online benefits.</li>
    <li>Built for Better – an online shopping destination that makes it easy for customers to identify and shop for
      products that are built better – for them and for the planet.</li>
